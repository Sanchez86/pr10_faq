                        Binary Options are the name for derivative financial instruments that create a contract between two sides for business transactions of assets where the future return on investment is a fixed sum known in advance.

                    <div class="accordionContent">
                        When Options expire ‘In the Money’, a trader’s return can reach up to 85%, dependent of course on the particular asset and the market volatility.  However traders know the amount before entering the position which allows them the possibility of high quality portfolio management. Take for example a trader who invests $1,000 on a binary option with an ROI of 85%. If the option expires ‘In the Money’, then the trader receives a return of $1,850.  If the Option expires ‘Out of the Money’, the trader loses the principal amount invested.

                        365 Binary Option determines the target price (also referred to as an option’s Purchase or Strike price) from a set of live pricing feeds that the Data Provider supplies. The price represents the amount at which we are willing to sell each individual option. You can buy an Option on either side of the target price according to the way that you consider that that asset may move in the market.

                    <div class="accordionContent">
                        The Expiry Time of an option is that point in time at which it will no longer be active. Then, all the investments made in that option are exercised, and clients will be allocated their profits accordingly. The Option’s Expiry Time is always clearly displayed directly in the trading platform next to the option.

                        Purchased options can be closed before the set Expiry Time of the option up until the ‘No More Trades’ time. This option is only available within a few minutes from the time of purchase. (Note: Close functionality is not active for all options or at all times). The broker adjusts the amount of profit based on the market price of the asset when the trader closes the position. The trading will also display this amount.

                        365 Binary Option calculates the Expiry Level based on real market bid, ask and last prices that the Data Provider provides by the time of the option expiry. Whether the option has expired ‘In the Money’ or ‘Out of the Money’ is determined by this Expiry Level. The calculation formulas for expiry are explained more fully in the Expiry Calculation section.

                    <div class="accordionContent">
                        When an option expires ‘In the Money’ the option is fulfilled as the trader’s projection was correct. Here are some examples of options that expire ‘In the Money’.
                        -          A High/Low Instrument in which a low option expires below the target price or a high option expires above the target price.
                        -          A One Touch Instrument in which a touch option expires due to reaching the target price or a no-touch option where the target price is not reached before the expiry time.
                        -          A Boundary Instrument in which an outbound option expires below the lower target price or above the upper target price or an inbound option expires between the target prices.
                        When an option expires ‘Out of the Money’ the condition of the option is not fulfilled as the trader did not successfully predict the outcome, therefore the principal investment is forfeited.

                    <div class="accordionContent">
                        The trader has the choice of estimating whether the option will expire above or below the target price. If the exact target price is reached by the asset at expiration, for both sides of the contract the result is considered a ‘Push’. In this case, 100% of the principal investment is returned to the trader. This occurs only with the High/Low option and is called ‘At the Money’.

                        This is the amount of money that a trader invests in an option and is the basis which determines the option’s profit or loss. If the trader is correct in his projection and the return is 85% on the option, he receives 85% of the investment amount as a return.

After the total amount of pending options has gone below $10,000, additional options can be entered until the maximum limit has been reached again.
